Describe the difference between ! and ? in Ruby. And explain what would happen
in the following scenarios:

what is != and where should you use it?
  This means 'not equals' and is used as a comparison operator
  Can be used in if statements, while, break conditions, etc.

put ! before something, like !user_name
  This is the unary operator (or bang operator) which returns the opposite
  boolean value of the objects truthiness. This can be used to convert an
  object into its opposite boolean value

put ! after something, like words.uniq!
  Putting the bang symbol at the end of something does not do anything
  in and of itself. Instead, it is a semantic marker meaning "dangerous!"
  Often it is used to indicate that the method is destructive or has some
  other behavior you should watch out for. However, there are destructive 
  methods that don't use the bang operator and there are many different ways
  a method can be destructive, so documentation should be consulted when you
  see the ! at the end of a method.

put ? before something
  Putting the ? before something is usually part of the ternary operator
  where you test the truthiness of the first expression, return the second
  expression if true and the third if false
  Example: "Strings evaluate as truthy" ? true : false

put ? after something
  Putting ? after something is a convention used to indicate that the method
  returns a boolean value

put !! before something, like !!user_name
  A double bang before something converts the object into its equivalent
  boolean value. So !!"string with stuff" == true
